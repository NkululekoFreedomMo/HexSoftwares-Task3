              The South African Football Association is the second Football Association in South Africa to be named the South 
              African Football Association and it is also the second football association in South Africa to affiliate to FIFA. 
              The present day South African Football Association, unlike its predecessor allows for a mixed-race national team.
              SAFA was admitted to FIFA in 1992 and its senior team has since represented South Africa at the Africa Cup of Nations 
              and the FIFA World Cup.[1] During SAFA's time as the FIFA-affiliated football organisation, South Africa has also
               hosted several editions of the COSAFA Cup, the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
